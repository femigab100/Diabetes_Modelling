# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes among women of different age groups using the popular Pima Indian Diabetes Database.

## Overview

Diabetes is a major health concern worldwide. Early detection can help in better management and prevention of serious complications. The Pima Indian Diabetes Database contains data collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for female patients of Pima Indian heritage aged 21 and older. This project leverages this dataset to train and evaluate a machine learning model that can predict the onset of diabetes.

## Features

- Utilizes the Pima Indian Diabetes Database
- Predicts diabetes risk specifically for women across various age groups
- Provides reproducible machine learning workflows
- Modular codebase for easy experimentation with different algorithms
- Three fold modelling using Linear Regression, Random Forest and SVM

## Dataset

The Pima Indian Diabetes Database contains the following features for each record:

- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose concentration
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Diabetes outcome (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Femigab100/Diabetes_Modelling.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    No special depedency required
    ```
3. Run the model training script:
    ```bash
    python Diabetes_model.ipnb
    ```
